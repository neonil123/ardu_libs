<div class="textblock"><p>This is the Arduino HopeRF library for operating with HopeRF HM-TR transceivers (see <a href="http://www.hoperf.com">http://www.hoperf.com</a>) It should also work with other 'transparent' serial transceivers. See <a href="http://www.open.com.au/mikem/arduino/HopeRF/HopeRF.pdf">http://www.open.com.au/mikem/arduino/HopeRF/HopeRF.pdf</a> for package download details, electrical details and documentation for connecting to HM-TR transceivers.</p>
<p>The latest version of this documentation can be downloaded from <a href="http://www.open.com.au/mikem/arduino/HopeRF">http://www.open.com.au/mikem/arduino/HopeRF</a></p>
<p>The version of the package that this documentation refers to can be downloaded from <a href="http://www.open.com.au/mikem/arduino/HopeRF/HopeRF-1.5.zip">http://www.open.com.au/mikem/arduino/HopeRF/HopeRF-1.5.zip</a></p>
<p>The HopeRF HM-TR transceiver is an inexpensive 433MHz 'transparent' serial transceiver. It handles internally all the issues of preamble, synchronisation etc (which is the bulk of the work in my other Arduino library, VirtualWire). Although the HM-TR is more expensive than the bare 433 MHz transceivers supported by VirtualWire, it requires much fewer compute resources from the Arduino (in fact the HM-TR has an ATMega on it specifically to do the serial-433MHz translation). However the HM-TR does not have any error detection built in. That is provided by this library.</p>
<p>This library provides classes for </p>
<ul>
<li>unaddressed, unreliable messages </li>
<li>addressed, unreliable messages </li>
<li>addressed, reliable, retransmitted, acknowledged messages.</li>
</ul>
<p>The Library has been tested on Arduino Mega, which has several serial ports besides the USB connection to the host PC. However, it would be expected to work with any Arduino with a serial port. The only connection required between the Arduino and the HM-TR module is power, received and transmit. The library is wrtten in C++, and compiles on Linux. With only a little work it could be expected to run on Linux with a suitable HardwareSerial impoentation, and using HM-TR with RS-232 connections.</p>
